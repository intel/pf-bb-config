pf_bb_config Release Note
=========================

24.07 new features and fixes
----------------------------
* VRB2: Enforce maximum 256 total queues configured per operation type.
* Prevent negative scenario with MMIO marginally outside of PF BAR.
* Cosmetic change to remind user to use VRB1 instead of deprecated ACC200, and VF mode by default.
* Cosmetic change to adjust log level when not required to be logged as INFO.
* Cosmetic change to remove obsolete directory ./acc200/ since ./vrb1 should be used.

24.03 new features and fixes
----------------------------
* Update support for Intel vRAN Boost v2 on GNR-D (Early Access Alpha) including VRB2 fixes.
* Refactor of the FFT window loading and documentation improvement of provided LUTs format.
* ACC100: Add an error report in case of exception after partial soft reboot and reconfiguration.
* Fix: Engines counters were not consistently exposed as part of Telemetry.
* Fix: Support for N3000 LTE using vfio-pci.

23.11 new features and fixes
----------------------------
* Initial support for Intel vRAN Boost v2 on GNR-D (Early Access Pre-Alpha).
* Expose the FFT windowing configuration towards bbdev-api PMD and respective window sizes.
* Fix: Increase the default arbitration FIFO depth.
* Fix: Response string missing for invalid address request.

23.07 new features and fixes
----------------------------
* Intel vRAN Boost v1 update to FFT windowing:
 * Update of the default FFT windowing bin file for VRB1.
 * Adding option to point to path of the FFT windowing bin file.
 * Support to expose the FFT window bin version number towards bbdev.
* Log management update. The device telemetry is now captured in a distinct file from the main log.
* Clean socket file in case still present after ungraceful exit.
* Protection to avoid illegal MMIO access.
* Fix to the -p option to allow a specific PCIe address to use.
* Fix to exception from negative test and coverity warning.

23.03 new features and fixes
----------------------------
* Intel vRAN Boost v1 (SPR-EE PRQ) specific changes :
 * Code refactor for refreshed product branding: ACC200 -> VRB1. Backward compatible usage.
 * Protection for MMIO Read interface to bar access to specific register range.
 * Explicit reset of SRAM to avoid risk of parity error false alarm.
 * Set explictly dynamic clock gating after reconfiguration.
 * Improvement to FFT memory loading after reconfiguration.
 * Improvement to the speed for reconfiguration after reset.
 * Extension of telemetry related to DMA latency measurements.
* Fix for minor coverity warnings.
* Fix minor leak with opened sysfs directory.
* Support for vfio-pci kernel module with N3000.
* Support for flexible number of queues with N6000.

22.11 new features and fixes
----------------------------
* Improvement for ACC200 accelerator management (still prePRQ)
  including mitigations for known sightings as well as RAS improvements.
* Removing the -a optional argument (all devices) which was not supported in practice.
* Support for FPGA N6000 variant (AGX100)
* Fix for handling negative scenario of mmap failure
* Fix for big endian build
* Fix for cli socket reliability

22.07 new features and fixes
----------------------------
* acc200: Support for ACC200 accelerator (SPR-EE Early Access)
* pf_bb_config: Support for CLI interface and telemetry
* pf_bb_config: Update to Makefile for stronger security check
* acc100: update of the PCIe adaptation for improved PCIe BER performance
* acc100: enabling queue at the end to prevent access while configuration is ongoing
* pf_bb_config: refactor logging mechanism

22.03 new features and fixes
----------------------------
* pf_bb_config: Remove dependency on inih library for config file parsing
* pf_bb_config: Support for binding PF to vfio-pci and related VF token
* config files: Adjustment for PF which only needs a single VF bundle set
* doc: Documentation update and clarifications

21.11 new features and Fixes
----------------------------
* acc100: range check for configuration file parsing
* acc100: report ROM version of ACC100 device
* acc100: clear persistent error registers
* acc100: avoid interrupt to be enabled by default
* acc100: adjust default DDR ROW address to be out of range
* build:  build script includes the version string
* doc: clarification on Readme documentation and reset procedure

21.06 new features and Fixes
----------------------------
* acc100: adjust the default fabric mode
* acc100: fixes Qmgr ARAM mapping based on number of VFs
* acc100: new examples of config files
