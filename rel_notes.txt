 * Improvement to FFT memory loading after reconfiguration.
 * Improvement to the speed for reconfiguration after reset.
 * Extension of telemetry related to DMA latency measurements.
* Fix for minor coverity warnings.
* Fix minor leak with opened sysfs directory.
* Support for vfio-pci kernel module with N3000.
* Support for flexible number of queues with N6000.

22.11 new features and fixes
